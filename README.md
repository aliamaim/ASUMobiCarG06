# Smart Controlled Car - ASUMobiCarG06

It is required to develop a Mobile Controlled Car. The car allow easy driving with obstacles avoidance, accurate movement, line tracking. 

## Installation

### Outline:

#### Easy Driving Application
* User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in easy driving mode.
* User can control car movement using mobile.
* User can move the car forward, backward, left and right.
* The car should avoid obstacles. 
* The minimum requirements of obstacle avoidance is stop to avoid collision.
* Bonus, for better avoidance techniques.

#### Line Tracking Application
* Students should prepare set of connected white sheets (2m x 2m) and draw track over it.
* User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in line tracking mode.
* When the car placed over the track it should follow the line.
* The minimum requirements is to use simple closed track.
* Bonus, for complex tracks with crossing points and sharp curves of radius less than 25 cm.

#### Advanced Applications (Bonus)
* Use GSM Shield to control car motion via mobile internet at open areas.
* Use WiFi Shield to control car motion via wifi internet at closed areas.
* Use GPS to retrieve car location at open areas.
* Use Camera and capture video stream from car to allow remote car driving.
* Use Camera and process image to avoid obstacles, recognize signs and avoid fall over.
* Integrate RF transmitter/receiver and make long distance remote control.
* Use multiple proximity sensors and implement auto park.
* Implement custom printed circuit board with Arduino chip and replace the driving board of existing car toy with smart one.
